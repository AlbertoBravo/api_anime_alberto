    <synopsis>In the year 2071, humanity has colonized several of the planets and moons of the solar system leaving the now uninhabitable surface of planet Earth behind. The Inter Solar System Police attempts to keep peace in the galaxy, aided in part by outlaw bounty hunters, referred to as &amp;quot;Cowboys.&amp;quot; The ragtag team aboard the spaceship Bebop are two such individuals.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
Mellow and carefree Spike Spiegel is balanced by his boisterous, pragmatic partner Jet Black as the pair makes a living chasing bounties and collecting rewards. Thrown off course by the addition of new members that they meet in their travels&amp;mdash;Ein, a genetically engineered, highly intelligent Welsh Corgi; femme fatale Faye Valentine, an enigmatic trickster with memory loss; and the strange computer whiz kid Edward Wong&amp;mdash;the crew embarks on thrilling adventures that unravel each member&amp;#039;s dark and mysterious past little by little.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Well-balanced with high density action and light-hearted comedy, [i]Cowboy Bebop[/i] is a space Western classic and an homage to the smooth and improvised music it is named after.&lt;br /&gt;

    <synopsis>Another day, another bounty&amp;mdash;such is the life of the often unlucky crew of the Bebop. However, this routine is interrupted when Faye, who is chasing a fairly worthless target on Mars, witnesses an oil tanker suddenly explode, causing mass hysteria. As casualties mount due to a strange disease spreading through the smoke from the blast, a whopping three hundred million woolong price is placed on the head of the supposed perpetrator.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
With lives at stake and a solution to their money problems in sight, the Bebop crew springs into action. Spike, Jet, Faye, and Edward, followed closely by Ein, split up to pursue different leads across Alba City. Through their individual investigations, they discover a cover-up scheme involving a pharmaceutical company, revealing a plot that reaches much further than the ragtag team of bounty hunters could have realized.&lt;br /&gt;

    <synopsis>Vash the Stampede is the man with a $$60,000,000,000 bounty on his head. The reason: he&amp;#039;s a merciless villain who lays waste to all those that oppose him and flattens entire cities for fun, garnering him the title &amp;quot;The Humanoid Typhoon.&amp;quot; He leaves a trail of death and destruction wherever he goes, and anyone can count themselves dead if they so much as make eye contact&amp;mdash;or so the rumors say. In actuality, Vash is a huge softie who claims to have never taken a life and avoids violence at all costs.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
With his crazy doughnut obsession and buffoonish attitude in tow, Vash traverses the wasteland of the planet Gunsmoke, all the while followed by two insurance agents, Meryl Stryfe and Milly Thompson, who attempt to minimize his impact on the public. But soon, their misadventures evolve into life-or-death situations as a group of legendary assassins are summoned to bring about suffering to the trio. Vash&amp;#039;s agonizing past will be unraveled and his morality and principles pushed to the breaking point.&lt;br /&gt;

Enter Monkey D. Luffy, a 17-year-old boy who defies your standard definition of a pirate.

Following in the footsteps of his childhood hero, Luffy and his crew travel across the Grand Line, experiencing crazy adventures, unveiling dark mysteries and battling strong enemies, all in order to reach the most coveted of all fortunes&amp;mdash;One Piece.&lt;br /&gt;

    <synopsis>Yakitate means &amp;quot;fresh baked&amp;quot;, but the word &amp;quot;Japan&amp;quot; is actually a pun - pan means bread in Japanese, so Kazuma is out to make Japan, a unique Japanese bread to compete with the best bread from around the world!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Azuma became obsessed with bread when he was six years old. His sister yelled that their family should start having bread for breakfast sometimes, but their grandfather refused to even consider it, as he would only eat natto, miso soup, and rice for breakfast. Kazuma agreed, saying he didn`t like bread, but his sister kidnaps him and takes him to a bread store to show him the wonders of fresh-baked bread. Not only is Kazuma converted, but the owner discovers that Kazuma has the magical &amp;quot;Hands of the Sun&amp;quot; whose warmth makes them particularly suited to making bread. The owner packs up shop and goes to Tokyo to fulfill his dream of making Japan, but Kazuma continues his bread-baking dream as well, and ends up going to Tokyo himself when he`s sixteen, to compete for a spot at the foremost bread store in Japan - Pantasia!&lt;br /&gt;

He volunteered to guide her way to the address she was looking for, which happened to be in his neighborhood, but turned out to be an empty lot. Not knowing what to do next, Kaoru invited the devastated girl to his apartment and asked for any additional clues to her destination.

    <synopsis>When computers start to look like humans, can love remain the same?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hideki Motosuwa is a young country boy who is studying hard to get into college. Coming from a poor background, he can barely afford the expenses, let alone the newest fad: Persocoms, personal computers that look exactly like human beings. One evening while walking home, he finds an abandoned Persocom. After taking her home and managing to activate her, she seems to be defective, as she can only say one word, &amp;quot;Chii,&amp;quot; which eventually becomes her name. Unlike other Persocoms, however, Chii cannot download information onto her hard drive, so Hideki decides to teach her about the world the old-fashioned way, while studying for his college entrance exams at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Along with his friends, Hideki tries to unravel the mystery of Chii, who may be a &amp;quot;Chobit,&amp;quot; an urban legend about special units that have real human emotions and thoughts, and love toward their owner. But can romance flourish between a Persocom and a human? &lt;br /&gt;

In an unexpected turn of events, however, Daisuke finds himself transforming into Dark Mousy, the infamous phantom thief, whenever his mind is set on Risa.

    <synopsis>One year ago, a UFO containing 150 aliens crash-landed off the shores of Kasai. Because no one could fix their ship, the Japanese Government decided to bestow upon them the designation &amp;quot;DearS&amp;quot; and make them into Japanese citizens, teaching them the language, customs, and culture of Japan. However, in order for them to become more familiar with human society, a home-stay program has been enacted to allow them to mingle with other humans.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One misty morning, a truck carrying a capsule that housed one of these aliens ends up dropping it into the riverbank, releasing her from her confinement. She is eventually found by a high school student named Takeya Ikuhara, who saves her from being hit by a truck and takes pity on her, despite being extremely distrustful of their race and wanting nothing to do with them. Upon being named Ren, she imprints upon him as her &amp;quot;Master&amp;quot; and serves as his personal &amp;quot;Slave,&amp;quot; leaving him with a &amp;quot;DearS&amp;quot; who wants to remain with him no matter what and bringing his ordinary, alien-free days to an end.</synopsis>

    <synopsis>Traumatized by school, Jun Sakurada spends his days at home as a shut-in, purchasing things online, only to send them back before the free trial period ends. So when a note appears on his desk, asking whether or not he would wind something, he assumes it was something he ordered and carelessly circles &amp;quot;yes,&amp;quot; changing his life forever.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
A box arrives with a wind up doll inside, but this is no ordinary toy: after Jun winds her up, she begins walking and talking as if a normal person. With a haughty attitude, she introduces herself as Shinku, the fifth doll in the Rozen Maiden collection, a group of special dolls made by the legendary dollmaker Rozen. These sisters must battle each other in a competition called the Alice Game with the help of a human to ensure victory. The winner becomes Alice, a real girl who is worthy of meeting their creator.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As more sentient dolls end up taking residence in Jun&amp;#039;s house, and a foe from Shinku&amp;#039;s past makes her appearance, Jun&amp;#039;s life becomes far more complicated than he ever thought possible.&lt;br /&gt;

    <synopsis>As the story of [i]Rozen Maiden[/i] closes, a new chapter begins in [i]Rozen Maiden: Tr&amp;auml;umend[/i]. Shinku and the other sentient dolls of the Rozen Maiden collection are living life as usual at Jun Sakurada&amp;#039;s house. Having settled into his role as Shinku&amp;#039;s partner in the deadly Alice Game, Jun overcomes his former fears and prepares to return to school. And although Shinku and the other dolls idly pass the days by in the comfort of Jun&amp;#039;s home, dark times lie ahead as a new foe presents herself: Barasuishou, the seventh Rozen Maiden.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But Barasuishou is a mystery even to her sisters, none of whom have ever laid eyes on her until now. Shinku considers this a sign that the Alice Game is coming to an end, meaning the dolls will soon be forced to fight one another. Haunted by the upcoming battle and nightmares concerning another doll, Shinku begins distancing herself from the others. If she wishes to claim victory, it will come at a high cost&amp;mdash;the lives of her sisters.&lt;br /&gt;

    <synopsis>Chiyo Mihama begins her high school career as one of the strangest students in her freshman class&amp;mdash;a tiny, 10-year-old academic prodigy with a fondness for plush dolls and homemade cooking. But her homeroom teacher, Yukari Tanizaki, is the kind of person who would hijack a student&amp;#039;s bike to avoid being late, so &amp;quot;strange&amp;quot; is a relative word.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There certainly isn&amp;#039;t a shortage of peculiar girls in Yukari-sensei&amp;#039;s homeroom class. Accompanying Chiyo are students like Tomo Takino, an energetic tomboy with more enthusiasm than brains; Koyomi Mizuhara, Tomo&amp;#039;s best friend whose temper has a fuse shorter than Chiyo; and Sakaki, a tall, athletic beauty whose intimidating looks hide a gentle personality and a painful obsession with cats. In addition, transfer student Ayumu Kasuga, a girl with her head stuck in the clouds, fits right in with the rest of the girls&amp;mdash;and she has a few interesting theories about Chiyo&amp;#039;s pigtails!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Together, this lovable group of girls experience the ups and downs of school life, their many adventures filled with constant laughter, surreal absurdity, and occasionally even touching commentary on the bittersweet, temporal nature of high school.&lt;br /&gt;

Years later, Gennosuke Kouga, heir of the Kouga clan, and Oboro Iga, heir of the Iga clan, have fallen in love. Through marriage, both heirs aim to bring peace to the clans.
